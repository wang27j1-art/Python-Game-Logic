# Python-Game-Logic
This repository contains logic-based games that I created in Python. They include a Monster Mash, Starship Duel, and an Adventure Game

## Monster Mash
This project generates a monster using lists and dictionaries. The user gets to name their monster. A second monster is also generated to battle the first.

## Starship Duel
Similar to Monster Mash, but with starships. Starship battle info (like health, attack, and defense) are contained in dictionaries and our used in the battle function. Both starships have defense

## Adventure Game
This game uses class Game that stores functions determining what places the player wants to explore, the choices they make, and stopping the game when the player quits or dies.
Note: This project might contain minor syntax issues. However, the encounter flow, battle system, and exploration are fully outlined
